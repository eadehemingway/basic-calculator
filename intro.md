## building blocks of coding

### String
``` "this is a string" ```
``` "980981023" ```
``` 'this is a string' ```
``` "a" ```
``` "true" ```


### Boolean
``` true ```
``` false ```

### Number
``` 23434 ```


### Objects and arrays - these hold the above in different structures.
``` {name: 'jess', is_developer: true, height: 5.7}```

``` [1, 2, 5, 6]``` 
``` ["a", "b", "c"]```




### variables (storing data types)
```var jess_info = {name: 'jess', is_developer: true, height: 5.7}```

### functions
``` 
function printName (name) {
    console.log("my name is" + name)
} 

var jess_name = "jess"
var eade_name = "eade"
printName(jess_name) // will print "my name is jess"
printName(eade_name) // will print "my name is eade"
```
